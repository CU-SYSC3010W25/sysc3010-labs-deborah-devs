# SYSC3010 Labs Repository for Deborah Ajayi
## Lab1
Lab1 is about setting up and configuring the Raspberry Pi on a monitor and a personal laptop. The lab involves running basic Python scripts and interacting with SenseHAT sensors.

Objectives

-Set up and configure an RPi with network access.

-Operate the RPi in both standalone and headless modes.

-Write and execute Python scripts on the RPi.

-Interact with SenseHAT sensors and display outputs.

-Use GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Scripts Included:

-showmyname.py: Displays the user's first and last name continuously on the Raspberry Pi.

-showsensordata.py: Displays the temperature, pressure, and humidity from the SenseHAT sensors on the Raspberry Pi.

## Lab2 

This lab focuses on working with SQLite databases on a Raspberry Pi. The exercises cover creating databases, inserting and retrieving data using SQL and Python, and visualizing data.

Exercises

-SQLite Command Line Interface: Installed SQLite, created a database and a table, and populated it with sample sensor data.

-Database Managers (GUI): Installed an SQLite GUI to interact with the database.

-Inserting Data using Python: Wrote Python scripts to insert and retrieve data using the sqlite3 library.

-Visualizing Data in Python: Used pandas, matplotlib, and plotly to visualize stored sensor data.
