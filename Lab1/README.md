# SYSC3010 Lab1 Deliverables
Lab1 is about setting up and configuring the raspberry pi on a monitor and a personal laptop. I practiced running code that would be displayed on the raspberry pi.

### Objectives
-Set up and configure an RPi with network access.

-Operate the RPi in both standalone and headless modes.

-Write and execute Python scripts on the RPi.

-Interact with SenseHAT sensors and display outputs.

Use GitHub for version control and collaboration.
### Scripts Included:
1. **'showmyname.py'**: This displays my first and last name continuously on the Raspberry Pi
2. **'showsensordata.py'**: This displays the temperature, pressure, and humidity from the SenseHAT sensors on the Raspberry Pi
